1. Running Time:

The running time for the function is growing at a linear speed
So the time complexity is linear "O(n)"
There is space allocated for the new array "altitude"
And there are 2 for loops within the function that runs proportional to the size of n
We have a time analysis of 3 + n which simplifies to O(n)


2. Space Requirement

We need to look at the total memory that has been allocated by the inputs of
the algorithm. Our algorithm allocates space based on the sizes of n. We found above
that the function has a linear running time. We allocated space when we made the
new array, and created the 2 for loops. Which makes the total space O(n).
